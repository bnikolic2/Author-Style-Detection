Everyone also seems to think article 5 would be activated in the event of a nuclear strike on Ukraine because of radiation crossing borders, hate to break it to everyone but they can detonate a nuke over Kiev with minimal fallout.
It's literally been stated by NATO, nuclear fallout affecting an allied nation would be a justifiable trigger for article 5.

But using any nukes at all in this fashion would have to result in russia getting cut off, and all nations in this know it including china.

They think it's going to turn off the ""moderate"" and ""centrist"" republicans by exposing how nuts conservatives are. They think this will push them into apathy about voting, or better yet get them to vote for centrist democrats. But democrats played this game in 2016 and lost.
